# Ansible Role: Common

This role manages several parts of a Linux system which are not worth their own role.

## Here be Dragons!

When managing DNS resolution with this role be aware of the following: On Ubuntu this role will remove the symlink on /etc/resolv.conf if it exists and replace it with a static file. The symlink originates in the `systemd-resolved` daemon. Managing that daemon is at least currently out of scope for this role. I know this not a beautiful solution but it works for me. If you know how to handle this better feel free to contact me or create a PR.

## Requirements

No special requirements; note that this role requires root access, so either run it in a playbook with a global `become: yes`, or invoke the role in your playbook like:

    - hosts: foobar
      roles:
        - role: ansible-role-common
          become: yes

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

ToDo

## Dependencies

None.

## OS Compatibility

This role ensures that it is not used against unsupported or untested operating systems by checking, if the right distribution name and major version number are present in a dedicated variable named like `<role-name>_stable_os`. You can find the variable in the role's default variable file at `defaults/main.yml`:

    common_stable_os:
      - Debian 10
      - Ubuntu 18
      - CentOS 7
      - Fedora 30

If the combination of distribution and major version number do not match the target system, the role will fail. To allow the role to work add the distribution name and major version name to that variable and you are good to go. But please test the new combination first!

Kudos to [HarryHarcourt](https://github.com/HarryHarcourt) for this idea!

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: foobar
